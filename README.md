# 🧩 Production Management Optimization Case (PMOS)
**Author:** Dean Phạm  
**Role:** Business Analyst  
**Project Type:** Business Analysis Case Study – SME Manufacturing (Vietnam)  

---

## 📘 Overview

This project presents a case about optimizing production management for **small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMEs)** in Vietnam.

The case addresses the common challenges faced by SMEs — such as **manual reporting**, **delayed decision-making**, and **data fragmentation** between HR, Production, and Quality Control departments — by designing a **low-cost, digital Production Management Optimization System (PMOS)**.

---

## 🎯 Business Context

Most SMEs in Vietnam still manage production using:
- Excel and paper-based tracking  
- Isolated HR and QC reporting  
- Manual daily summaries with 1–2 days delay  

As a result, they face:
- **Idle time and delayed shift planning**  
- **Low production visibility and inaccurate KPIs**  
- **Disconnection between HR, Production, and QC**

**PMOS** solves this by introducing an **integrated, low-code solution** (Google AppSheet / Odoo / Power BI) that tracks production performance, operator attendance, and quality metrics **in real-time**.

---

## 🧠 Project Goal

To design a **digital transformation blueprint** for SMEs that:
- Enhances **operational efficiency** and **data accuracy**
- Enables **real-time performance visibility**
- Provides **automated reporting and KPI dashboards**
- Reduces **manual work and decision latency**
