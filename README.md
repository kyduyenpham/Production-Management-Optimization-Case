# üè≠ Production Management Optimization Case  
**A Business Analyst Case Study by Dean Ph·∫°m**  

---

## üß≠ Project Overview  

This project presents a **Business Analysis case study** on optimizing **production management processes for small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMEs)**.  

The goal was to **reduce inefficiencies, manual work, and data fragmentation** by proposing a **lean digital Production Management System (PMS)** that integrates planning, operations, and HR data for real-time visibility and performance tracking.  

The case study simulates a real-world BA workflow ‚Äî from stakeholder elicitation to requirement documentation and solution design ‚Äî following **BABOK-aligned practices**.

## üéØ Business Objective  

> To streamline production operations for SMEs by introducing a simple, scalable, and affordable digital workflow that improves planning accuracy, reduces downtime, and enhances decision-making visibility.  

**Expected Outcomes:**  
- Reduce manual reporting and delays by automating daily operation tracking  
- Integrate HR attendance with production planning  
- Visualize machine and operator performance (OEE, downtime, efficiency)  
- Improve data accuracy and team collaboration across departments
